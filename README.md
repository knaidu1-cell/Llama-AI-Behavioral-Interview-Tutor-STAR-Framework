Project Overview
The AI Behavioral Interview Tutor is an interactive application designed to help job seekers practice for behavioral interviews. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze user prompts and generate structured responses using industry-standard frameworks (STAR and SOAR).

Methodology
The Problem
Candidates often struggle to structure their interview answers concisely or choose the wrong narrative structure for the question asked.

The Solution
We built an interactive chatbot that:

Analyzes Intent: Identifies if a question is a standard behavioral prompt or a strategic failure/obstacle question.
Selects Framework: Automatically routes to STAR (for standard stories) or SOAR (for strategic challenges).
Generates Structure: Streams a token-by-token sample response to guide the user.
Key Features
Intelligent Framework Selection: automatically detects if a question is best answered using STAR (Standard) or SOAR (Strategic/Failure-based) frameworks.
Real-time Streaming: Answers are streamed token-by-token for a responsive user experience.
Context Awareness: Maintains chat history to provide context-aware feedback.
Dockerized Deployment: Fully containerized using Docker for consistent deployment on the university cluster.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based UI)
Backend Logic: Python 3.12
AI Model: Llama 3.1 (hosted via Ollama)
Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
CI/CD: GitLab CI
Data Persistence (Database)
The application utilizes an embedded SQLite database (interview_history.db).

Why SQLite? We chose a lightweight, file-based database to maintain session history locally within the container.
Function: It records user prompts and AI responses, allowing the "History" feature to function without the overhead of external database dependencies like Postgres.
