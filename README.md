AI Behavioral Interview Tutor
Live Demo

Project Overview
The AI Behavioral Interview Tutor is an interactive application designed to help job seekers practice for behavioral interviews. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze user prompts and generate structured responses using industry-standard frameworks (STAR and SOAR).

Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based UI)
Backend Logic: Python 3.12
AI Model: Llama 3.1 (hosted via Ollama)
Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
CI/CD: GitLab CI
Data Persistence (Database)
The application utilizes an embedded SQLite database (interview_history.db).

Why SQLite? We chose a lightweight, file-based database to maintain session history locally within the container.
Function: It records user prompts and AI responses, allowing the "History" feature to function without the overhead of external database dependencies like Postgres.
